About
-

A Slimefun addon about making the world a little better

It includes new electric system, new cargo system, and some special machines and items now.

This Slimefun addon is not means to destroy the existing balance of Slimefun, and the difficulty will be added while more items is being added by other Slimefun addons.(But
There is a lot of items here that could link with other Slimefun addons, so it will be a great experience if you add many Slimefun addons with it)

It should be friendly to server TPS, as some optimization strategies are provided.

Before beginning
-

Please remember that this slimefun addon is not mean to let player make huge assembly line, though here is many machines and items could help player to do this. It's about to give player more possibilities to do some cool things that is related to Slimefun.
